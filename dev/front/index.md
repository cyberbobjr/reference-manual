# Getting started

If youâ€™ve used [skeletons](https://github.com/entcore/skeletons) to initialize your application, you already have a gulpfile, a webpack config file, and a npm package file. To start front-end development, you first need to install nodeJS 6.11.

<https://nodejs.org/en/>

Then, you can go in your application folder and install all dependencies:

`npm install`

You will also need to make the gulp command available:

`npm install -g gulp@3.9.1`

# Gulp commands

Two gulp commands are available in your application:

`` gulp `build` ``

will start building your typescript files, bundle them in a single file, and add cache-busting utilities.

> **Warning**
>
> You need to use gulp build before gradle install, as Gradle (the server-side build tool) will use your current resources directory.

The second one is

`gulp watch`

This will start a process listening to all changes made to your files, build them and copy them to your springboard directory. You can set your springboard path with the springboard parameter:

`gulp watch --springboard /path/to/my/springboard`

This also works with relative paths:

`gulp watch --springboard ../my/springboard`
